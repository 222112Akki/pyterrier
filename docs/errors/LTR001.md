# LTR001 - Input does not contain a features columns

## Cause

You are trying to construct a LTR pipeline, but you have not constructed any features.

## Example

The following pipeline will raise a TypeError with LTR001.

```python
pipe = pt.BatchRetreve(index) >> pt.ltr.apply_learned_model(xgboost)
pipe.fit(topics)
```

Indeed, a LTR pipeline requires a feature column, while BatchRetrieve will not add a features column (although FeaturesBatchRetrieve can also be used). This can be constructed using the `**` operator, or using other LTR-compatible pipeline objects.

## Resolution

```python
pipe = (
    pt.BatchRetreve(index) 
    >> ( pt.BatchRetreve(index, wmodel='BM25')  **  pt.BatchRetreve(index, wmodel='PL2') ) 
    >> pt.ltr.apply_learned_model(xgboost)
pipe.fit(topics)
```
