# LTR003 - Found x features, but requesting to keep/ablate feature id y

## Cause

You are trying to ablate a feature with id higher than exists in the pipeline.

## Example

The following pipeline will raise a TypeError with LTR003.

```python

firstpass = pt.BatchRetrieve()
features = (pt.apply.doc_score(_fn1) ** pt.apply.doc_score(_fn2))
ablate = firstpass >> features >> pt.ltr.ablate_features(2)
ablate(topics)
```

Here the first index is 2, while the feature ids (i.e. array offsets are) 0 and 1.


## Resolution

Pick a feature id smaller than the number of features in the pipe.
